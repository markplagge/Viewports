Viewports
=========

For CSU's Computer Graphics Class, we assembled a virtual Solar System. This is the "Viewports" part of the project.

This is an example of using viewpoints to observe different parts of the solar system.
This project only has a few planets, but shows how to do this sort of thing using OpenGL. 

This was a class where we had to learn C++ and OpenGL constructs at the same time. So this code was not the cleanest 
that I have ever created. However, the system does work, and it is nice to see 3D in OpenGL.
